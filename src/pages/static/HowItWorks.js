        <h1>How It Works</h1> FrontWork Component Marketplace is a marketplace
        to buy and sell frontend components. As a seller, you can list
        components you've coded for sale. As a buyer, you receive the code for
        the component upon purchase. Components are delivered as HTML, React,
        Vue, or framework of your choice. You can view the framework,
        programming language and styling library for a component by clicking on
        the component.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        <h1>Payment Models </h1>We offer two different payment models: Purchase
        individual components - pay the listed price in the marketplace Monthly
        subscription - subscribe to a monthly plan to receive a certain number
        of component downloads each month.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h1>License</h1> By purchasing a component you have the right to make
        use of the code in your own projects. You do not have the right to sell
        on the code as is. Sellers As a seller, you are paid 90% of the sale
        price when one of your components is purchased. If the buyer is on one
        of our monthly subscription plans and uses a download credit to buy a
        component, the payment you receive is calculated as follows: The monthly
        fee is divided by the number of components the purchaser has made that
        month. You recieve 90% of that amount for each of your components that
        was unlocked up to a maxium of $10 per component. For example, if a
        buyer is on a $30 per month plan, and uses 3 credits that month you will
        receive $9 (90% of $10) for each component of yours they unlock. As part
        of promotions and marketing efforts, FrontWork reserves the right to
        offer free credits which can be used to purchase components without
        charge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h1>Sellers</h1> do not receive payment when a free credit is used to
        unlock a component. Sellers may only upload code for components they own
        the rights to. We reserve the right to make changes to our terms and
        conditions in the future. If you are unhappy with these changes you may
        remove your components from the marketplace.
